Customer chunk analysis and visualization

Churn Analysis and Visualization
This repository contains a Python-based project to analyze customer churn data from the Churn_Modelling.csv dataset. The project is structured into three tasks: data exploration, basic statistical analysis, and data visualization, using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Features
Task 1: Data Loading and Exploration
Loads a dataset in CSV format.
Displays the first few rows of the dataset for quick inspection.
Explores the dataset's structure, including data types and missing values.
Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
Computes basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
Groups data by categorical columns (e.g., Geography) and calculates aggregated metrics (e.g., average balance).
Identifies patterns and insights in the data.
Task 3: Data Visualization
Generates four types of visualizations for in-depth analysis:
Line Chart: Trends in CreditScore across different ages.
Bar Chart: Average balance for customers grouped by geography.
Histogram: Distribution of customer age.
Scatter Plot: Relationship between balance and estimated salary, color-coded by churn status.
Libraries Used
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.
seaborn: For enhanced and aesthetically pleasing plots.
**How to Use**
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Francischebo/Wk7_Basic-Data-Analysis-plp.git
Ensure the Churn_Modelling.csv file is in the repository's directory.
Run the script using Python:
bash
Copy code
python answers.py
The visualizations will be displayed as output, and insights will be printed in the console.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains customer details, including demographics, account balance, credit score, and churn status.

Insights
Provides a clear understanding of customer demographics and behaviors related to churn.
Highlights trends and relationships in the data through visualizations.
